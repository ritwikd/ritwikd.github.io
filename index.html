                          Worked with Professor Radu Marculescu at Carnegie Mellon University last summer (2015) on big-data analysis of academic social networks. I investigated how different participants in an academic conference collaborate, and outlined a methodology to characterize the “fairness” of such collaborations. An “unfair” collaboration would be one where relationships (between authors and program committee members) that were conflicts of interest either gave some authors advantages, or others disadvantages, in paper acceptance likelihood and co-authorship desirability. I focused on capturing the relationship between the program committee members and the regular authors of a conference, including co-authorship and institutional linkages, and derived a quotient to quantify the “fairness” of the collaboration, hence that of the conference. My findings offer insights into the evolution of special communities or interest groups that tend to form in an academic network with the sole purpose of promoting interests with regard to professional growth of individuals in these communities at the cost of denying privileges to individuals outside the communities. My results can be used to guide and optimize policies regarding the rules of engagement in academic conferences and workshops; the methodology is applicable to a study of other complex social networks as well.

                                Worked with Professor Marilyn Wolf at Georgia Tech last year (2014) and implemented health dashboard software for collecting patient data in smart homes using household sensors like cameras and fitness bracelets. I used various web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), database (Mongo), server (Flask, SimpleHTTPServer), and cloud computing (Jawbone) technologies to design the software, and had to carefully consider various design tradeoffs. I chose Mongo over an SQL database because it is easier to deploy, Flask over a Django web framework because it is lighter and simpler to use, and SimpleHTTPServer over more typical nginx or Apache web servers because it has no external dependencies. The front- end of the software allows adding users, logging into the system, selecting health data of interest, specifying health goals, and displaying user health metrics against target goals with correlations between metrics, e.g., sleep or movement versus weather pattern. The back-end comprises a database that stores user profiles and health data. The software provides a foundation on which a real-life health monitoring system can be easily built.

                                Created a recommendation engine for GitHub - the free-to-use software storage website. If a user specifies a software project of interest, KARE finds and recommends other similar projects on GitHub. The text box next to the logo on the KARE website is where a user specifies a project of interest. For example, if a user selects a project called "d3", which contains software for drawing charts and graphs on websites, a column will appear on the left, titled "Results for d3”, and will contain a list of similar software projects generated by KARE. Last time I ran a query, three example results returned by KARE were "sigma.js" - another graph drawing library, "dc.js" - a 3D graphing library, and "cube" - a chart visualization tool. KARE obtains these matching results by counting how many of the same users “liked” each repository – the higher the count, the better

                                Prepared a comprehensive set of educational slides for my school computer science club and robotics camp to introduce computer science concepts using JavaScript (JS). I have organized my ideas and opinions, as well as used my own JS programs, to explain the concepts I learned from different textbooks and the web. I have touched upon the fundamentals of computers, basics of JS, and common data structures and algorithms first, before including interesting programming concepts from one of my favorite books, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). SICP influenced my ideas on computers and programming, and I wished to share my thoughts and perspectives on this topic with others. I started on importing some of the interesting concepts from SICP, but have so far only got to Higher Order Functions and Function Abstractions; I hope to soon cover more of the concepts from SICP, and convert its illustrative examples from Scheme (the language used in the book) to JS.

                                Was hired as an external software consultanty by Lytmus, a San Francisco-based company looking to revolutionize the sourcing and assessment of technical talent using a sophisticated virtual-machine beased platform that allows engineers to demonstrate their knowledge in realistic and practical settings and simultaneously providing useful, high-quality data to potential employers. I provided detailed feedback and analysis of the challenges and tests created to further refine the target and quality of assessments so they provided more meaningful data to potential employers.

                                Was hired as an external project leader and frontend engineer by MAXKeyboard, a Fremont, CA-based custom-keyboard designer. The existing platform for consumer-side customization of keyboards was a phone call from the buyer to the company describing the ideal customization. I created an online keyboard-configuration application with a primarily ecommerce-focused design where the user could intuitively customize  a realistic-looking imageless keyboard rendered using raw CSS and HTML.

                                        Attached is an academic paper I wrote based on my research on academic social networks. I did my research this past summer (2015) with Professor Radu Marculescu and his graduate students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU. I was interested in big data before, and this research gave me big insight into efficient extraction, sensible representation, and meaningful analysis of large electronic data sets. Review of existing literature and past work also taught me about network science and use of graph theory in predictive analysis. The analysis methodology we proposed in the paper can handle a complex set of variables, hence can be extended to analyze different types of complex social networks. In particular, I believe our results can be used to guide and optimize policies regarding the rules of engagement in different academic events. The project was not only a great learning experience, I also made new friends in Professor Marculescu's graduate student group.

                                        Attached is my publication at the 2015 International Conference on Systems and Software Engineering, describing my implementation of health dashboard (http://gtd.ritwikd.com/) software for collecting patient data in smart homes using household sensors like cameras and fitness bracelets. I did this work last summer (2014) with Professor Marilyn Wolf at Georgia Tech. I used various web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), database (Mongo), server (Flask, SimpleHTTPServer), and cloud computing (Jawbone) technologies to design the software. The front-end of the software allows adding users, logging into the system, selecting health data of interest, specifying health goals, and displaying user health metrics against target goals with correlations between metrics, e.g., sleep or movement versus weather pattern. The back-end comprises a database that stores user profiles and health data. The software provides a foundation on which a real-life health monitoring system can be easily built.
